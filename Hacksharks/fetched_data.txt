Equilibrium solutions that approximate omnigenity have previously been discovered for the special cases of quasi-symmetry and quasi-isodynamicity, but general omnigenity is a much larger design space than these subsets. A new model is presented and employed in the DESC stellarator optimization suite to represent the full omnigenity parameter space. Examples far from quasi-symmetry with poloidally, helically, and toroidally closed contours of magnetic field strength are shown to have low neoclassical collisional transport throughout a volume.\n        ', "\n            We determine the effect of intergalactic magnetic fields on the distribution\nof high energy gamma rays by performing three-dimensional Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the development of gamma-ray-induced electromagnetic cascades in\nthe magnetized intergalactic medium. We employ the so-called 'Large Sphere\nObserver' method to efficiently simulate blazar gamma ray halos. We study\nmagnetic fields with a Batchelor spectrum and with maximal left- and\nright-handed helicities. We also consider the case of sources whose jets are\ntilted with respect to the line of sight. We verify the formation of extended\ngamma ray halos around the source direction, and observe spiral-like patterns\nif the magnetic field is helical. We apply the $Q$-statistics to the simulated\nhalos to extract their spiral nature and also propose an alternative method,\nthe $S$-statistics. Both methods provide a quantative way to infer the helicity\nof the intervening magnetic fields from the morphology of individual blazar\nhalos for magnetic field strengths $B \\gtrsim 10^{-15}\\,{\\rm G}$ and magnetic\ncoherence lengths $L_{\\rm c} \\gtrsim 100\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. We show that the\n$S$-statistics has a better performance than the $Q$-statistics when assessing\nmagnetic helicity from the simulated halos.\n        ", '\n            As research into magnetic thin films and spintronics devices is moving from single to multiple magnetic layers, there is a need for micromagnetics modelling tools specifically designed to efficiently handle magnetic multilayers. Here we show an exact method of computing demagnetising fields in magnetic multilayers, which is able to handle layers with arbitrary spacing, arbitrary thicknesses, and arbitrary relative positioning between them without impacting on the computational performance, or sacrificing numerical accuracy. The multilayered convolution method is a generalisation of the well-known convolution method used to compute demagnetising fields in a single magnetic body. In typical use cases, such as multilayered stacks used to study skyrmions, we show the multilayered convolution method can be up to 8 times faster, implemented both for central processors and graphics processors, compared to the simple convolution method.\n        ', '\n            Based on the theoretical description of Position-Position-Velocity(PPV) statistics in Lazarian & Pogosyan(2000), we introduce a new technique called the Velocity Decomposition Algorithm(VDA) in separating the PPV fluctuations arising from velocity and density fluctuations. Using MHD turbulence simulations, we demonstrate its promise in retrieving the velocity fluctuations from PPV cube in various physical conditions and its prospects in accurately tracing the magnetic field. We find that for localized clouds, the velocity fluctuations are most prominent at the wing part of the spectral line, and they dominate the density fluctuations. The same velocity dominance applies to extended HI regions undergoing galactic rotation. Our numerical experiment demonstrates that velocity channels arising from the cold phase of atomic hydrogen (HI) are still affected by velocity fluctuations at small scales. We apply the VDA to HI GALFA-DR2 data corresponding to the high-velocity cloud HVC186+19-114 and high latitude galactic diffuse HI data. Our study confirms the crucial role of velocity fluctuations in explaining why linear structures are observed within PPV cubes. We discuss the implications of VDA for both magnetic field studies and predicting polarized galactic emission that acts as the foreground for the Cosmic Microwave Background studies. Additionally, we address the controversy related to the filamentary nature of the HI channel maps and explain the importance of velocity fluctuations in the formation of structures in PPV data cubes. VDA will allow astronomers to obtain velocity fluctuations from almost every piece of spectroscopic PPV data and allow direct investigations of the turbulent velocity field in observations.\n        ', "\n            Precise knowledge of magnetic fields is crucial in many medical imaging applications like magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic particle imaging (MPI) as they are the foundation of these imaging systems. For the investigation of the influence of field imperfections on imaging, a compact and unique representation of the magnetic fields using real solid spherical harmonics, which can be obtained by measuring a few points of the magnetic field only, is of great assistance. In this manuscript, we review real solid harmonic expansions as a general solution of Laplace's equation including an efficient calculation of their coefficients using spherical t-designs. We also provide a method to shift the reference point of an expansion by calculating the coefficients of the shifted expansion from the initial ones. These methods are used to obtain the magnetic fields of an MPI system. Here, the field-free-point of the spatial encoding field serves as unique expansion point. Lastly, we quantify the severity of the distortions of the static and dynamic fields in MPI by analyzing the expansion coefficients.\n        ", '\n            We present a novel numerical method for solving the anisotropic diffusion equation in toroidally confined magnetic fields which is efficient, accurate and provably stable. The continuous problem is written in terms of a derivative operator for the perpendicular transport and a linear operator, obtained through field line tracing, for the parallel transport. We derive energy estimates of the solution of the continuous initial boundary value problem. A discrete formulation is presented using operator splitting in time with the summation by parts finite difference approximation of spatial derivatives for the perpendicular diffusion operator. Weak penalty procedures are derived for implementing both boundary conditions and parallel diffusion operator obtained by field line tracing. We prove that the fully-discrete approximation is unconditionally stable and asymptotic preserving. Discrete energy estimates are shown to match the continuous energy estimate given the correct choice of penalty parameters. Convergence tests are shown for the perpendicular operator by itself, and the ``NIMROD benchmark" problem is used as a manufactured solution to show the full scheme converges even in the case where the perpendicular diffusion is zero. Finally, we present a magnetic field with chaotic regions and islands and show the contours of the anisotropic diffusion equation reproduce key features in the field.\n        ', "\n            We investigate the generation of magnetic fields from non-linear effects\naround recombination. As tight-coupling is gradually lost when approaching\n$z\\simeq 1100$, the velocity difference between photons and baryons starts to\nincrease, leading to an increasing Compton drag of the photons on the\nelectrons. The protons are then forced to follow the electrons due to the\nelectric field created by the charge displacement; the same field, following\nMaxwell's laws, eventually induces a magnetic field on cosmological scales.\nSince scalar perturbations do not generate any magnetic field as they are\ncurl-free, one has to resort to second-order perturbation theory to compute the\nmagnetic field generated by this effect. We reinvestigate this problem\nnumerically using the powerful second-order Boltzmann code SONG. We show that:\ni) all previous studies do not have a high enough angular resolution to reach a\nprecise and consistent estimation of the magnetic field spectrum; ii) the\nmagnetic field is generated up to $z\\simeq 10$; iii) it is in practice\nimpossible to compute the magnetic field with a Boltzmann code for scales\nsmaller than $1\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. Finally we confirm that for scales of a few ${\\rm\nMpc}$, this magnetic field is of order $2\\times 10^{-29}{\\rm G}$, many orders\nof magnitude smaller than what is currently observed on intergalactic scales.\n        ", '\n            We present a novel open-source Python software package, bfieldtools, for magneto-quasistatic calculations with current densities on surfaces of arbitrary shape. The core functionality of the software relies on a stream-function representation of surface-current density and its discretization on a triangle mesh. Although this stream-function technique is well-known in certain fields, to date the related software implementations have not been published or have been limited to specific applications. With bfieldtools, we aimed to produce a general, easy-to-use and well-documented open-source software. The software package is written purely in Python; instead of explicitly using lower-level languages, we address computational bottlenecks through extensive vectorization and use of the NumPy library. The package enables easy deployment, rapid code development and facilitates application of the software to practical problems. In this paper, we describe the software package and give an extensive demonstration of its use with an emphasis on one of its main applications -- coil design.\n        ', "\n            We attempt to forecast M-and X-class solar flares using a machine-learning\nalgorithm, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and four years of data from the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, the first\ninstrument to continuously map the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic field\nfrom space. Most flare forecasting efforts described in the literature use\neither line-of-sight magnetograms or a relatively small number of ground-based\nvector magnetograms. This is the first time a large dataset of vector\nmagnetograms has been used to forecast solar flares. We build a catalog of\nflaring and non-flaring active regions sampled from a database of 2,071 active\nregions, comprised of 1.5 million active region patches of vector magnetic\nfield data, and characterize each active region by 25 parameters. We then train\nand test the machine-learning algorithm and we estimate its performances using\nforecast verification metrics with an emphasis on the True Skill Statistic\n(TSS). We obtain relatively high TSS scores and overall predictive abilities.\nWe surmise that this is partly due to fine-tuning the SVM for this purpose and\nalso to an advantageous set of features that can only be calculated from vector\nmagnetic field data. We also apply a feature selection algorithm to determine\nwhich of our 25 features are useful for discriminating between flaring and\nnon-flaring active regions and conclude that only a handful are needed for good\npredictive abilities.\n        ", '\n            Surface currents provide a general way to model static magnetic fields in source-free volumes.

In this work, we describe the physical and computational principles of this toolset. To be able to work with surface currents of arbitrary shape, we discretize the currents on triangle meshes using piecewise-linear stream functions. We apply analytical discretizations of integral equations to obtain the magnetic field and potentials associated with the discrete stream function. In addition, we describe the computation of the spherical multipole expansion and a novel surface-harmonic expansion for surface currents, both of which are useful for representing the magnetic field in source-free volumes with a small number of parameters.
